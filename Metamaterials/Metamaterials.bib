In contrast to conventional lenses, which are constructed of materials with positive index and require a curved surface or inhomogeneous structures to focus light or other electromagnetic radiation, no curvature is needed with a LHM because of a negative effective index of refraction. Such a flat lens has the advantage of being capable of changing the focal length by simply changing the distance between the electromagnetic source and the lens.}",

abstract = {We show that equivalent circuits offer a qualitative and even quantitative simple explanation for the behavior of various types of left-handed (or negative-index) metamaterials. This allows us to optimize design features and parameters while avoiding trial and error simulations or fabrications. In particular, we apply this unifying circuit approach in accounting for the features and in optimizing the structure employing parallel metallic bars on the two sides of a dielectric film.},
